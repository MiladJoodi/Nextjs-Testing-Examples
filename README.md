# 🧪 React Component Testing Examples

This repository contains a collection of tests for different types of React components  
using **Jest** and **React Testing Library**.

The goal is to create a reference with real-world test examples, including:
- Forms with `onSubmit` handlers
- Input validation and value assertions
- Button clicks and user interaction
- Using `jest.fn()` to spy on function calls
- Fetching data from APIs with loading and error states
- Simple and complex component behavior

Each folder in `components/` includes a demo component along with its test file.
